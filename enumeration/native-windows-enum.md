# Native Windows Enumeration

This document covers techniques for enumerating Active Directory environments using only native Windows tools and commandsâ€”no external binaries or scripts required. This approach is essential when tool uploads are blocked or for stealthier assessments.

## Scenario
Assume you are on a managed host with no internet access and cannot load external tools. The goal is to enumerate the AD environment using only what is built into Windows.

## Host & Network Recon with Native Commands

### Basic Enumeration Commands
| Command                                      | Description                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `hostname`                                  | Prints the PC's name                             |
| `[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version`    | OS version and revision                          |
| `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn` | Lists patches and hotfixes applied     |
| `ipconfig /all`                             | Network adapter state and configurations         |
| `set` (CMD)                                 | Lists environment variables                      |
| `echo %USERDOMAIN%` (CMD)                   | Displays the domain name                         |
| `echo %logonserver%` (CMD)                  | Shows the Domain Controller in use               |

**Example:**
```powershell
hostname
[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
ipconfig /all
set
```

### System Summary
- `systeminfo` provides a summary of host information in one command.

**Example:**
```powershell
systeminfo
```

## PowerShell for Recon
- Use built-in cmdlets for environment, policy, and history checks.

| Cmdlet/Command                                         | Description                                      |

| `Get-Module`                                           | Lists loaded modules                             |
| `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`                            | Shows execution policy for each scope            |
| `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`            | Temporarily bypasses execution policy            |
| `Get-ChildItem Env: | ft Key,Value`                    | Lists environment variables                      |

Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
Get-ChildItem Env: | ft Key,Value
```
